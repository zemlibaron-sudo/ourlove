    <p>We actually crossed paths long before we ever became “us.”<br>
    Back then, we both wanted something, but life had other plans.<br>
    My mind was messy, my life wasn’t ready,<br>
    and even though we liked each other…<br>
    we couldn’t turn it into love yet.</p>
    <p>But fate wasn’t done with us.<br>
    Months later, we met again — this time at Lockdown Bajar.<br>
    It was such a simple place, such a normal moment,<br>
    but somehow it felt different… warmer.</p>
    <p>That night, you texted me.<br>
    One message… then one more…<br>
    and suddenly we were talking for hours,<br>
    like two people who had been waiting for the right time to find each other again.</p>
    <p>Slowly, we decided to give “us” a chance.<br>
    I’ll be honest — at first, my feelings were quiet.<br>
    But yours weren’t.<br>
    You cared for me.<br>
    You stayed.<br>
    You loved me even when I didn’t know how to love myself.<br>
    You never gave up on me — not even once.</p>
    <p>And little by little, your effort became my feelings.<br>
    Your patience became my comfort.<br>
    Your heart became my home.</p>
    <p>And that’s how our relationship finally bloomed —<br>
    not suddenly, not perfectly,<br>
    but beautifully, slowly,<br>
    and exactly the way real love is supposed to grow.</p>
    <p>💗 From “maybe someday” to “finally us.”<br>
    That’s our story.</p>
